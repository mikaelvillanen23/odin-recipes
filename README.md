Foundations Recipes project

In this project I will be practising basic html with basic text elements, lists, links and images.
I will also be required to be organised with my files.

Thoughts after finishing this project: 't was fun. Almost the most effort went to finding the kind of free pictures I was looking for! But I do think I got a good basic understanding of elementary html writing. Also this was very good practise for using Git and the command line!
